   You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 2 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

**Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.**  
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Work:

2. If You include all or a substantial portion of a database in which the Work is contained in a database that You Share under this Public License, then the database in which You include the Work (but not necessarily the entire database if it does not contain the Work or a substantial portion thereof) is Adapted Material.

**Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.**  

1. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.**

   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.  
3. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Work under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Work at any time, but doing so will not terminate this Public License.
